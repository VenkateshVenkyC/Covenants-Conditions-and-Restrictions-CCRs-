**Understanding CCRs is essential for buyers to ensure the property aligns with their expectations and plans. By maintaining standards and enforcing rules, CCRs aim to preserve the community’s value and appeal.**

### **Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs)**

---

### **Definition**  
**Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CCRs)** are legally binding rules, limitations, and guidelines placed on properties within a subdivision or planned community. They are established to maintain the uniformity, aesthetics, and value of the properties. CCRs are typically enforced by a **Homeowners’ Association (HOA)** or a similar governing body.  

- **Covenants**: Promises regarding property use, such as maintaining a specific exterior design.  
- **Conditions**: Legal requirements tied to ownership, potentially leading to penalties or forfeiture if violated.  
- **Restrictions**: Specific limitations, such as prohibiting commercial use of residential properties.

### **How It Relates to Title**  
1. **Recorded in the Title**:  
   CCRs are included in the property deed and recorded in public records. During a title search, they are reviewed to ensure the buyer understands any limitations.  

2. **Binding on Current and Future Owners**:  
   - CCRs apply to all owners and automatically transfer with the property upon sale.  
   - The HOA or developer enforces the rules.  

3. **Impact on Property Use**:  
   - CCRs regulate architectural designs, landscaping, fencing, and allowable uses of the property.  
   - They may impose restrictions on leasing, parking, or home modifications.  

4. **Influence on Value and Decision-Making**:  
   - They help maintain property value within the community by enforcing standards.  
   - Buyers must evaluate if the restrictions align with their intended use of the property.

#### **3. Restrictions**
